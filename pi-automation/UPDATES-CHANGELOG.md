# Pi Automation Updates Changelog

## 2025-06-22 Fixes

### 1. Fixed CSS Selector Issues
- **Problem**: The automation was failing with error: `Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document': 'div:has(h2:contains("St Kilda Gigs"))' is not a valid selector`
- **Solution**: Replaced jQuery-style selectors (`:has()` and `:contains()`) with standard DOM traversal methods
- **Impact**: The automation can now properly detect success messages on the page

### 2. Improved Slack Notification Handling
- **Problem**: Slack notification failures were causing the entire process to hang
- **Solution**: Made Slack notifications non-blocking by removing the await and adding catch handler
- **Impact**: The automation will complete even if Slack notifications fail

### 3. Enhanced Local Testing Support
- **Problem**: Local testing was too strict, failing if either carousel had issues
- **Solution**: Added special handling for local test mode to be more forgiving
- **Impact**: In local testing, success is now counted if ANY carousel posts successfully

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- **Problem**: Error messages weren't detailed enough for troubleshooting
- **Solution**: Added more detailed error reporting and response text capture
- **Impact**: Easier to diagnose issues when they occur

## Deployment Instructions

These changes should be deployed to the Raspberry Pi using:

```bash
# From your local machine
./pi-automation/deploy-changes.sh 192.168.0.152 insta
```

After deploying, you may want to test the automation:

```bash
# SSH into the Pi
ssh insta@192.168.0.152

# Run the automation manually
cd ~/instabear_pi
node pi-automation.js
```

These changes should resolve the issues that have been causing the Pi automation to fail for the last 5 days.
