# Download Button Feature - Summary

## Task Completed
We've designed and planned the implementation of a "Download Images" button feature for the Instagram gallery, which will allow users to download all images for a specific area (St Kilda or Fitzroy/Collingwood/Richmond) as a zip file.

   - Testing instructions
   - Deployment instructions
   - Potential issues and solutions

## Feature Overview

The feature adds a "Download Images" button next to each "Post to Instagram" button in the Instagram gallery. When clicked, the button will:

1. Create a zip file containing all images for that specific area
2. Trigger a download of the zip file
3. Update the status message to indicate success or failure

The button will only appear after images have been generated, just like the "Post to Instagram" button.

## Implementation Details

The implementation requires:

1. Adding JSZip and FileSaver libraries to the project
2. Adding a new `handleDownloadImages` function to the Carousel component
3. Adding a new "Download Images" button next to the "Post to Instagram" button
4. Updating the UI to accommodate the new button

## Next Steps

To implement this feature:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install jszip file-saver --save
   ```

2. Follow the implementation plan in `download-button-implementation.md` to make the necessary code changes

3. Test the feature thoroughly to ensure it works as expected

4. Deploy the changes to production

## Benefits

This feature will provide users with an alternative to posting images directly to Instagram. They can download the images and:

- Share them on other platforms
- Archive them for future reference
- Edit them before posting
- Use them for other purposes

This adds flexibility to the application and enhances the user experience.
